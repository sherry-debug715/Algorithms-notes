## Description
Given a sorted array (ascending order) and a target number, find the first index of this number in O(logn) time complexity.

If the target number does not exist in the array, return -1.

### Example 
```py
tuple = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]
target = 3
# Output 2

tuple = [1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 10]
target = 6
# Output -1 
```
