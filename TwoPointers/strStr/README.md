- Problem: for a given source string and a target string, you should output the first index(from 0) of target string in the source string.If the target does not exist in source, just return -1.

> Note: Do I need to implement KMP Algorithm in a real interview? - Not necessary. When you meet this problem in a real interview, the interviewer may just want to test your basic implementation ability. But make sure you confirm how to implement with the interviewer first.

- compare method one with method two, method two seems to be more simple and easy to read, much less lines of code written. The only problem is that for each substring that's created by source[idx:idx+target_length], we are incrementing our space complexity, the interviewers prefers if you can write your own helper function to achieve the comparison. See method 3. Now, there is a mistake in all 3 methods, I didn't consider an edge case where source is None or empty.
